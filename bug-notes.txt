This bug was resolvd by adding the missing and needed dependency for dotenv.
Without the installation of dotenv the environment variables could not be read from the .env file and thusly the JWTSECRET was not included in requests.
This issue caused a downstream impact in the createUser function indicating the token signing failed.
The token signing fails when the secret value was being passed as NULL. 
This issue was resolved with the following steps:
1. Install dotenv package to the SERVER folder via NPM
2. ENSURE a .env file is included in the SERVER folder with a JWTSECRET value included in the file.
